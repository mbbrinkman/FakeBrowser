# FakeBrowser

An AI-powered browser that generates imaginary websites on the fly. Type any URL and watch AI create what that page would look like - completely disconnected from the real internet.

## What is this?

FakeBrowser is a browser simulation where every website is generated by AI in real-time. There's no actual internet connection - instead, when you navigate to a URL, an AI model imagines what that website would contain and generates a complete HTML page.

**Features:**
- Full browser UI with tabs, navigation, address bar
- Any URL works - real sites get "imagined", fake sites get invented
- Working links - click through to explore the AI-generated web
- Search boxes work - forms submit and generate new pages
- Tab support with Ctrl+T, Ctrl+W, middle-click to open in new tab
- Page caching in IndexedDB for instant back/forward
- Multiple AI models via OpenRouter

## Try it

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Click the ⚙️ settings button
3. Add your [OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
4. Pick a model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, etc.)
5. Navigate to any URL and explore!

## Fun URLs to try

- `google.com` - AI-generated search results
- `wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_Topic` - Imaginary encyclopedia entries
- `news.ycombinator.com` - Fake Hacker News
- `reddit.com/r/anything` - AI-generated subreddits
- `amazon.com` - Fake products with fake reviews
- `definitely-not-skynet.ai` - ???
- `claudeopus45secretdiary.com` - AI writes fanfic about AI

## How it works

1. You enter a URL
2. The URL is sent to an AI model via OpenRouter
3. A system prompt instructs the AI to generate a complete HTML page
4. The page is rendered in an iframe with link/form interception
5. Clicking links repeats the process

All data (settings, page cache) is stored locally in IndexedDB.

## Files

- `index.html` - Browser UI
- `style.css` - Dark theme styling
- `browser.js` - Tab management, navigation, rendering
- `ai-service.js` - OpenRouter API, IndexedDB storage
- `system-prompt.js` - Instructions for AI page generation
